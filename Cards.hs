  mapM_ (\(i, card) -> putStrLn $ show i ++ " " ++ card) (zip [0..] cards')

{-
  \(i, card) -> putStrLn $ show i ++ " " ++ card

  1) This is a lambda function â€” an anonymous spell.
  2) It takes a tuple (i, card) and prints it like: 0 Ace of Diamonds
  3) show i converts the index to a string.
  4) ++ is string concatenation.

  zip [0..] cards'

  5) zip pairs the card with it's index
